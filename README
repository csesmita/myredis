Through the developer's mind
-----------------------------

This was what was thought when making this project:
1. Implement simple TCP Server at port EXOREDIS_SERVER_TCP_PORT
2. Test telnet echoes a server response for the telnet request (connection request and special request)
3. Implement REDIS protocol at server
4. Repeat step 2.

Limitations:
1. Does not support FD set. Only one client may connect to this server for now.
2. .exordb file format is slightly different. Only length-key-value make up the
   entries for now.
3. No buffering of requests. For now one re quest is followed by response, in
   that order.
