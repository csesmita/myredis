Through the developer's mind
-----------------------------

This was what was thought when making this project:
1. Implement simple TCP Server at port EXOREDIS_SERVER_TCP_PORT
2. Test telnet echoes a server response for the telnet request (connection request and special request)
3. Implement REDIS protocol at server
4. Repeat step 2.

Limitations:
1. Does not support FD set. Only one client may connect to this server for now.
2. .exordb file format is slightly different. Only length-key-value make up the
   entries for now.
3. No buffering of requests. For now one request is followed by response, in
   that order.
4. An upper limit of 1000 entries are set for this DB. This is defined in
   exoredis_rdb.h
5. READ: Lazy copy of DB from file to hash table. When a read occurs, the hash
   table is first looked up. A hit returns the value. A miss looks up the  DB
   file, retrieves the value, enters it into the hash and returns.
6. WRITE: Write always writes the value of the key into the hash table
7. SAVE (Or Program Exit): For each entry in hash table, create or update value
   into DB file. Since DELETE is not implemnented, no other case needs
   handling.
